## Usage

Release builds are still not ready. You can build the application manually by following the instructions in the [Development](#development) section.

## Development

Working on NuclearRT has a bit of a strange workflow. The easiest way to do it is:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Symbolic Link for the exporter from `nuclearrt\exporter\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows` to `Clickteam Fusion 2.5\Data\Runtime\nuclearrt\exporter`
3. Create a Symbolic Link for the base runtime from `nuclearrt\runtime` to `Clickteam Fusion 2.5\Data\Runtime\nuclearrt\runtime`

If you make any changes to the exporter:
1. `dotnet build` in the `exporter` directory.
2. Build the application in Fusion.

If you make any changes to the base runtime:
1. Build the application in Fusion.
